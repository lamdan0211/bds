			<h3>Appearance</h3>
			<p>
				All Theodore Alexander products are manufactured to the highest standards with natural materials and the utmost care and attention to detail. Whilst we make every effort to accurately reproduce the colors of the furniture illustrated, there will be variations in grain pattern and color by the very nature of the highly individual characteristics of natural materials. Some changes in color or texture may occur during the life cycle of the product, particularly in leather, wood and veneer. For further material characteristics please see the Furniture Care section of the website.</p>
				<p>Items are photographed in studio conditions and as such the appearance of an item in your home may vary from the images shown on our website.</p>
				<p>Theodore Alexander reserves the right to amend the specifications of any product featured on this site without notice. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our website content, this website may contain errors and out of date information as regards imagery, specifications, products or prices. Accordingly, all such information is non-binding and no liability is accepted from any errors therein. We will use all reasonable endeavors to rectify any errors.</p>
				<p>Images of upholstered items in leathers and fabrics are representative of materials available at the time of manufacture and of a particular dye lot. Color and texture of fabrics may change slightly based on mill production. Since most fabric mills do not guarantee their materials for durability, color fastness and fading, dye lot variations, or adverse reaction to environmental conditions, we are unable to honor claims, adjustments or details in these areas over which we have no control.</p>
				<p>Fabric options vary by piece. Some fabric options are manufactured to order. Please contact your Theodore Alexander representative or Dealer for details.</p>
