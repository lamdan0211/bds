				Theodore Alexander is expanding the range of choices within the Alexa Hampton collection this spring with a new custom finish program.
			</p>
			<p class="news4-title">
				The program features a multitude of custom colors and finishes to enhance the 120-piece collection, originally introduced at the April 2019 High Point Market. Options include more than 40 wood tones, ranging from Hipster Gray and Caramel to Cobalt and Passion Fruit. The selection also includes a variety of exotic luxe leaf finishes as well as elegant gold and silver striping.
			</p>
			<p class="news4-title">
				The one thing all designers and homeowners should avoid is repeating the same finish or wood tone too often,” said Alexa Hampton about the strategy behind the new custom finish program. She added that the program will facilitate an endless range of creative options personalized to individual living spaces.
