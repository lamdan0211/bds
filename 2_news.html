	<p>You know it’s going to be a good year for design when Jamie Drake has new releases to show off. He is to the High Point Market what Rolex is to Baselworld. Unfortunately, both of these influential trade fairs have been canceled on account of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but for Drake and furniture manufacturer Theodore Alexander, the show must go on. On the heels of two successful, feverishly touted Theodore Alexander collections from Alexa Hampton and Richard Mishaan in 2019, this year Drake turned up the drama with glamorous millwork tables—from cocktail to console—inspired by the natural world, with insect and reptile motifs as well as stone and ancient symbolism. Each piece is a statement, unified by luster and brightness; none of these will easily fade into the background of a room—but that’s the point. “They speak loudly about the optimistic future of home,” Drake says. Here, he tells us about five pieces from this highly anticipated collection.</p>

				“The sinuous and magical nature of the serpent is a constant in literature through the ages,” Drake says. “An ancient symbol of infinity—the ouroboros, a serpent devouring its own tail—is ready to support libations forever.”

				“This table was conjured as if sprung from the piper’s flute, evoking hypnotizing exotica in a contemporary manner. Polished brass sinuously embraces a luscious lacquer shaft. A cast-brass border surrounds an inset mirrored top.”

				“The facets of a diamond have captured the imagination for centuries. This table features the sharp allure of the finest gemstones in their geometry. Covered entirely in mother-of-pearl set in an intricate puzzle pattern, it is dazzling, the surface beguiling.”

				“The oak-veneer case is elevated on a Parsons-style base. The doors feature the Negoro Nuri finish, based on a 12th-century Japanese technique involving layers of lacquer built up and sanded through, an artful reference to history. Delicate brass pulls pick up the golden hues of the tortoiseshell palette.”

				“Inspired by a stunning jewelry exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Reed tables were the result of a fascinating neck collar. The linear beauty of an ancient craft is modernized in a minimal way, enriched with a gilt finish. Oak tops in the Evening finish create a beautiful contrast.”
